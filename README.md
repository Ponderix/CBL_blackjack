# Blackjack Game - Java Project 

This project is a simple version of the Blackjack card game, created using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It includes key classes like Card, Person, Player, and Dealer, with inheritance to manage game logic such as checking for busts and wins. 

The game mechanics cover shuffling and dealing cards, as well as calculating hand values. The game works with text-based feedback and a basic GUI using Java Swing. The project is tracked on GitHub with regular updates, version control, and a clear structure.
